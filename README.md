## Summary
I am undertaking this project as part of a class at Sogang University with the guidance and assistance of my advisor, Professor Jeong (https://jdasam.github.io/maler/). I embarked on this project with the aim of exploring the correlations between song titles and their musical features. However, due to my limited experience and capacity to independently pursue this project in-depth, I had to alter my initial plan. Consequently, I utilized the representation vectors obtained from training the model to conditionally generate melodies for Irish folk music.
